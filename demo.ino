======
Bit mask of GPIO numbers which will cause wakeup. Only GPIOs
                which have RTC functionality can be used in this bit map.
                For different SoCs, the related GPIOs are:
                  - ESP32: 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 25-27, 32-39
                  - ESP32-S2: 0-21
                  - ESP32-S3: 0-21
                  - ESP32-C6: 0-7
                  - ESP32-H2: 7-14
